# WIP, ONLY THE API WORKS CURRENTLY
# Price Drop Checker

- This is a program that checks an Amazon order history CSV for items that are within return window and their price.
- The backend was written in GO Lang and hosted on AWS API Gateway. The frontend was written in React JS and is hosted on AWS S3.
- Created by Timothy Orlov, Noah Terminello, and Adi (add last name)

# (Planned) Usage

- Follow the link to get Amazon order history CSV
- Upload the CSV
- Recieve a list of items in the return window and their current price V.S. purchased price

# Known Problems

- Amazon throttles calls to it's own site without an API, resulting in some prices being incorrect
